\description{
A dataset of 140 patients suffering from traumatic injuries, originally collected and analysed by
Wiertsema et al. (2019). The dataset compares two treatment options: usual care (`trt = 0`) and the
novel Transmural Trauma Care Model (TTCM, `trt = 1`). The treatment assignment was not randomised.
}
\details{
This dataset is provided as part of the \pkg{subart} package to illustrate methods for
cost-effectiveness analysis. **If you use this dataset in publications or presentations, please cite
both Wiertsema et al. (2019) and Esser et al. (2024).**


The dataset contains cost and health-related quality of life outcomes, as well as baseline covariates.
Costs (\code{C}) are measured from the healthcare perspective, combining the TTCM intervention cost,
hospital records, and patient-reported healthcare resource use obtained from questionnaires administered
over nine months after treatment. Quality of life (\code{Q}) is measured using the EQ-5D-3L instrument,
administered once at nine months
post-treatment.

Missing survey items related to \code{C} and \code{Q} in the original data were imputed by predictive
mean matching using the \pkg{mice} package, following Wiertsema et al. (2019). This dataset represents
one completed imputed dataset.
