# subart

**`subart`** is an R-implementation for an extesion for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for multiple outcomes, based on the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) paradigm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of subart from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MateusMaiaDS/subart")
```
